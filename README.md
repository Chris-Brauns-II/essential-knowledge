I didn't understand the difference between a computer scientist and a software engineer until I graduated. This repo shows the computer scientist all the things they didn't realize they needed to know. 

# Purpose
To provide a bridge for a graduate computer science major wishing to become a master software engineer

# How to Contribute
This is meant to be a collaborative project. Let's help our peers bridge the gap!
